# Personal-Knowledge-Assistant
The Personal Knowledge Assistant is an intermediate-level Generative AI project that implements a complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. This system allows users to upload their documents and ask intelligent questions about the content, receiving accurate answers with source citations.
üß† What is RAG?
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a cutting-edge AI technique that combines:

Information Retrieval: Finding relevant document chunks based on user queries
Text Generation: Creating human-like responses using the retrieved context
Source Attribution: Providing citations and references for transparency

Unlike traditional chatbots that rely solely on training data, RAG systems can access and reason about specific documents in real-time, making them perfect for personalized knowledge management.
